# Refactoring of Ironforge Collection Service

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to improve the architecture of the Ironforge Collection Service, focusing on better separation of concerns, decoupling database operations from business logic, and improving overall code organization.

## Key Changes

### 1. Repository Pattern Implementation

- Created a dedicated repository module for database operations
- Separated database connection logic from business logic
- Implemented proper session management with context managers
- Created type-hinted methods for database operations

### 2. Utility Functions Reorganization

- Moved utility functions from root-level `utils` directory to `src/utils`
- Enhanced documentation and improved function signatures
- Added proper error handling and edge case management

### 3. Architecture Improvements

#### Database Connection Management
- Created `src/repository/database.py` with connection management utilities
- Implemented session context manager for automatic transaction handling
- Added configuration from environment variables

#### Auction Repository
- Created `src/repository/auction_repository.py` with specialized methods
- Added batch operations for performance optimization
- Properly typed return values for better IDE support

#### Auction Collector
- Refactored to use repository instead of direct database access
- Improved error handling and logging
- Separated API interaction from database operations

### 4. New Scripts

- Created `src/scripts/collect_auctions.py` as a simple example script
- Created `src/scripts/scheduled_collector.py` for automated collection
  - Added command-line arguments for flexibility
  - Implemented retry logic and continuous operation mode
  - Added proper logging
